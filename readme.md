## MY-SKELETON

### About
```Skeleton``` is a lightweight CSS framework (or boilerplate, if you prefer this definition) created by ```Dave Gamache```.
The framework provides styles those for standard HTML elements and includes a ```grid```, but that’s often more than enough to get started. If we need any additional components, we have to develop by customizing the css. The most important part of Skeleton is its ```grid system```, the framework provides basic styles for common HTML components like buttons, lists, tables, and forms.

### Getting Started
To getting start using ```Skeleton``` is just clone this repo below :

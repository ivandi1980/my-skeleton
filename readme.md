## MY-SKELETON

### About
Skeleton is a lightweight CSS framework (or boilerplate, if you prefer this definition) created by Dave Gamache.
The most important part of Skeleton is its grid system, which I’ll analyze later in this article. Additionally, the framework provides basic styles for common HTML components like buttons, lists, tables, and forms.
